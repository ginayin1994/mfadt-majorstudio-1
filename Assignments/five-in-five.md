* 7 minutes presentation each person
* 30 minutes group discussion afterwards

## Questions
* What are some rules you put in place for your project?
* What is the relationship between concept and execution?
* Is there something that ties the projects together?
* How could you have improved them?
* Did you enjoy the exercise, why or why not? What were some struggles?
